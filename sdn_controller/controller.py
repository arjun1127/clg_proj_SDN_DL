# Receives LSTM Predictions via UDP (port 5001) from APs.
# Stores Traffic Load per AP in self.ap_predictions.
# Handles Incoming Packets and redirects traffic to the least congested AP.
# Installs Dynamic Flow Rules in OpenFlow switches to optimize vehicle communication.
#  Receive LSTM predictions from APs (e.g., traffic load, latency, etc.)
#  Analyze network congestion based on predicted values
# Modify flow tables dynamically to optimize vehicle data routing
# Ensure minimal load on the SDN controller by using only LSTM-based decisions

#SDN Controller's Role:

# Centralized Intelligence: It makes decisions (like redirecting traffic based on LSTM predictions) and then installs flow rules into the data plane devices (the switches).
# Policy Enforcement: It controls how traffic is routed and managed across the network, similar to a routerâ€™s function, but it doesn't physically forward the packets itself.

# Data Plane Devices:

# Switches/APs: The actual packet forwarding is done by the switches (configured as APs and the central switch) in your Mininet topology.
# Routing Decisions: The controller's decisions result in the installation of flow rules in these switches, which then handle the packet forwarding according to those rules.



# Port Statistics Collection

# The controller requests port stats every 5 seconds (self._monitor()).
# Received stats are logged to a CSV file (network_stats.csv).
# Retains LSTM Prediction Handling

# The controller still listens for LSTM predictions and uses them for traffic redirection.
# Efficient Traffic Monitoring

# Uses Ryu's hub.spawn() to run monitoring in the background.
